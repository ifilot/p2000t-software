# P2000T Software Preservation

Preservation of software for the Philips P2000T home computer, originating from cartridges, mini-cassettes and disks.

In this repo you can find:

* [Cartridge images](/cartridges/) of P2000T cartridges like 'Basic Interpreter' and 'Familiegeheugen'.
* [Cassette programs and games](/cassettes/) dumped from mini-cassette. Some recommended arcade conversions are: Brick-Wall (Breakout clone), Doolhof (3D Maze clone), Fraxxon (Phoenix clone), Ghosthunt (Pac-Man clone) and Lazy Bug (Lady Bug clone).
* [Disk images](/disks/) for the JWS Disk System.
* [Utilities](/utilities/) for archiving/dumping P2000T cassette programs to PC, but also for loading P2000T programs from PC back to your P2000T again. Note: these utilities require a serial connection cable.
